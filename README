  g4tools is the technical backend of the Geant4 analysis category along of the Geant4
 visualization ToolsSG drivers. (The overall philosophy for us was/is to continue attempting
 to have as much as possible an "academic way" for doing data analysis and visualization).

  The files under the g4tools/tools,toolx directories are copies of the ones found under
 the source/externals/g4tools/include/tools,toolx directories of the Geant4 repository.

  The programs found under tests/cpp are not distributed within Geant4 and are local to
 this repository. (They are still used for some regular nightlies on Linux at IJCLab).

  Historically, the g4tools code were part of the softinex inlib/exlib pure header libraries
 where the namespaces "inlib" and "exlib" were changed automatically to "tools" and "toolx",
 but now (since 2021) it follows a life of its own within Geant4 and then in this repository.
