  g4tools is part of the softinex inlib/exlib code used as the
 technical backend of the Geant4 analysis category. (The namespaces
 "inlib" and "exlib" had been automatically changed to "tools"
 to keep some naming consistency within Geant4 and avoid clashes
 when building our Geant4 apps (g4exa, g4view, MEMPHYS_vis) that
 uses too inlib/exlib).

  For web pages, see the section g4tools under the softinex portal at :
    https://gbarrand.github.io

 (It is a new place, the old http://softinex.lal.in2p3.fr is anyway
 valid up to the final migration on git pages)

  See also the tools.license file for terms.
