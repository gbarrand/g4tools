  The code of g4/tools is an automatic extraction of part
 of the inlib/exlib that is used, among other things,
 to build the ioda application. The namespace "inlib"
 and "exlib" had been automatically changed to "tools"
 by the procedure. Modifications or corrections must be done
 in the original inlib/exlib code and not in the
 g4/tools packing. If wanting to do some, please contact
 the author. The web pages of inlib/exlib can be
 accessed from the softinex portal :
