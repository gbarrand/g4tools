  The code of g4/tools is an automatic extraction of part
 of the inlib/exlib that is used, among other things,
 to build the ioda application. The namespace "inlib"
 and "exlib" had been automatically changed to "tools"
 by the procedure. Modifications or corrections must be done
 in the original inlib/exlib code and not in the
 g4/tools packing. If wanting to do some, please contact
 the author.

  For web pages, see the section g4tools under the softinex portal at :
     https://gbarrand.github.io

 (It is a new place, the old http://softinex.lal.in2p3.fr is anyway
 valid up to the final migration on git pages)

  See also the tools.license file for terms.
